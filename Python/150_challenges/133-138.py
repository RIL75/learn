Create a new program that will generate two random whole numbers between 10 and 50. It should ask the user to add the numbers together and type in the answer.

They should click on a Next button to get another question.

Create a simple program that shows a drop-down list containing several colours and a Click Me button. When the user selects a colour from the list and clicks the button it should change the background of the window to that colour. For an extra challenge, try to avoid using an if statement to do this.

Create a program that will ask the user to enter a name and then select the gender for that person from a drop-down list. It should then add the name and the gender (separated by a comma) to a list box when the user clicks on a button.

Change program 136 so that when a new name and gender is added to the list box it is also written to a text file. Add another button that will display the entire text file in the main Python shell window.

Save several images in the same folder as your program and call them 1.gif, 2.gif, 3.gif, etc. Make sure they are all .gif files. Display one in a window and ask the user to enter a number. It should then use that number to choose the correct file name and display the correct image.
